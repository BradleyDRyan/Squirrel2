# Function Call Execution Fix

## The Problem
The OpenAI Realtime API streams function call arguments character by character. The Swift library creates `functionCall` entries as data arrives, but we were trying to execute functions before receiving complete arguments, causing:
- Truncated JSON arguments
- Failed function executions
- Need for JSON repair hacks

## The Solution
Wait for **complete** function calls before executing tools. The key insight: **Tools should only fire when the model is DONE generating the function call**.

## Implementation Changes

### 1. Accumulate Arguments Until Complete
```swift
// Store function call info as it streams in
functionCallInfo[functionCall.id] = (
    name: functionCall.name,
    arguments: existing.arguments + functionCall.arguments,  // Accumulate
    firstSeen: Date()
)
```

### 2. Validate JSON Completeness
```swift
// Only execute when we have valid, complete JSON
if isValidJSON(info.arguments) && !processedFunctionCalls.contains(functionCall.id) {
    // NOW it's safe to execute the function
    let result = await functionHandler.handleFunctionCall(...)
}
```

### 3. Fallback Timeout
As a safety net, process function calls after 2 seconds if JSON still isn't complete:
```swift
if now.timeIntervalSince(info.firstSeen) > 2.0 {
    // Try to process (handler will attempt to fix JSON)
}
```

## Key Event Flow

### What Happens:
1. Model decides to call function
2. Library creates `functionCall` entry with partial arguments
3. More arguments stream in, we accumulate them
4. When JSON is complete and valid, we execute the function
5. Send result back to conversation
6. Model continues with the result

### What We Listen For:
- `functionCall` entries appearing in `conversation.entries`
- Multiple updates with the same `functionCall.id` 
- Valid JSON structure indicating completion

## Testing

Test with these commands:
1. "Create a task to buy groceries"
2. "Add a reminder to call mom at 3pm"
3. "List all my tasks"
4. "Mark the grocery task as complete"

Watch the console for:
- üéØ Function call detected
- üìù Current arguments (accumulating)
- ‚úÖ Complete function call ready
- üöÄ Executing function
- ‚úÖ Function result

## Why This Works

The Realtime API sends function arguments in chunks via `response.function_call_arguments.delta` events. While the Swift library doesn't expose these granular events, it does update the `functionCall` entries as data arrives. By:

1. **Accumulating** arguments from multiple updates
2. **Validating** JSON completeness
3. **Only executing** when data is complete

We ensure tools fire at the right time - when the model is DONE, not during streaming.

## Future Improvements

1. **Library Update**: When swift-realtime-openai adds proper `response.done` event support, switch to that
2. **Raw WebSocket**: For full control, implement direct WebSocket connection to handle all events
3. **Event Buffering**: Build a proper event queue to handle `response.function_call_arguments.delta` events
